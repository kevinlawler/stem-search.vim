" StmSrch is a reverse-stem searching script. It implements the Porter stemming
" algorithm, by Martin Porter, details of which can be found at:
"   http://tartarus.org/~martin/PorterStemmer/
" It also uses tables for irregular verbs and noun pluralizations. 
" 
" StmSrch command syntax:
"   :StmSrch (<word>)*
"   :ClrStmSrch
"
" Each word input to the :StmSrch command will be stemmed and then formulated
" in such a way as to match possible conjugations or pluralizations. Without 
" any word given for input, it will attempt to stem the current word under the
" cursor via expand('<cword>').
"
" For example:
"   :StmSrch search
" will match any of:
"   search, searching, searches, searchers, searched, ...
" and a string of words will work as well, matching in order:
"   :StmSrch thieves are running from bunnies
" will match strings of words like: 
"   thief was ran from bunny
"   thieves be run from bunnies
"
" Use :ClrStmSrch to clear the highlighting for the StmSrch group.
"
" Change the highlight color for StmSrch in the s:StmSrchInit() function
"
" To rebuild the irregular verb or plural noun tables, run:
"   ./scripts/buildIrrDicts.pl [v|n] <irregularWordFile>
" where <irregularWordFile> is a file of word forms, one synset per line and
" the [v|n] option specifies the filename ending to keep output organized
" This script outputs two files, keys.[v|n] and dict.[v|n], which are then
" used to build the dictionaries in the script such as irrNNSKeyDict/irrNNSDict.
" There are two files of these words in the data directory
"
" This was originally written for my own usage, so it may be missing certain
" features that could easily be added in (e.g. multiple-buffer operations).
