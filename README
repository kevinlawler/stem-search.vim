StmSrch is a reverse-stem searching script. It implements the Porter stemming algorithm, by Martin Porter. It also handles irregular verbs and noun pluralizations.

This script can be useful for searching or scanning through corpus files.

Each word input to the :StmSrch command will be stemmed and then formulated in such a way as to match possible conjugations or pluralizations. Without
any word given for input, it will attempt to stem the current word under the cursor.

For example: 
- :StmSrch search 
will match any of: 
- search, searching, searches, searchers, searched, ...
and a string of words will work as well, matching in order: 
- :StmSrch thieves are running from bunnies 
will match strings of words like: 
- thief was ran from bunny 
- thieves be run from bunnies
